Hi! This is a hobby program script I made to help me at work. It is for Rush Radiologists, for use ONLY at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. 
It is a very specific program I made for use with the software programs that we use currently, and will almost CERTAINLY NOT WORK if you are not using the same software setup.
It is a simple script that allows the user to tally studies and save it as a simple text file in a folder of your choosing. 
It does this by scraping the accession number and study details from an open MModal fluency dictation report. To log a currently open dictation study, use hotkey WIN+ALT+L or hit the blue LOG button. It won't allow you to log one you've already logged (it will be greyed out).
It also scrapes the name of the ordering provider and can page them using the Rush paging website (hotkey WIN+ALT+P).
Additionally, it has a calcium score feature which hooks into the MESA calcium score website (hotkey WIN+ALT+C).

- DISCLAIMER: This script does NOT save any identifiable patient information, only the accession number and type of study, and it does so locally ONLY. NO SENSITIVE DATA IS TRANSMITTED OR TRANSFERRED.
- *THIS IS MEANT FOR PERSONAL AND/OR INTERNAL USE WITHIN THE RUSH HOSPITAL SYSTEM, AND I WILL NOT BE HELD LIABLE IF YOU USE THIS IRRESPONSIBLY OR FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES. HIPAA RULES ARE IMPORTANT, PLEASE RESPECT THEM. USE WITH CAUTION AND AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- *** IMPORTANT -- THIS WILL ONLY WORK WITH AUTOHOTKEY VERSION 2.0.18 OR LATER *** Please do not try to use with older versions. 
- One more time: PLEASE RESPECT HIPAA RULES. I am NOT responsible for how you use this program, and if you do so irresonsibly, that is on you. If you use this for ANY purpose that breaks the law and try to hold me liable, I will respond with appropriate legal action (i.e. scorched earth). This is not a joke.
